//***FILE 496 is from Ken MacKenzie and contains a REXX exec to     *   FILE 496
//*           display your TSO session's dataset allocations.       *   FILE 496
//*           Better than LISTA.  There are others like it, but     *   FILE 496
//*           this one's good, too.                                 *   FILE 496
//*                                                                 *   FILE 496
//*           This exec works well with the DISP exec from File     *   FILE 496
//*           487.  TSO DISP TIOT  is the command, and you can      *   FILE 496
//*           then ISPF VIEW your allocations.                      *   FILE 496

//*           Ken's exec has been modified by Marty Kuntz.  We      *   FILE 496
//*           have kept the old exec as member TIOT01.  The new     *   FILE 496
//*           one is member TIOT.                                   *   FILE 496
